## Known issues

* Cookies grow too large after about 26 prompts so we randomly sample down to numdays + 1 (days required to win). If the game needs to be run longer, we must rework prompts to being based off of ideas so they can be moved out of cookies. Requiring users to only store a list of ID ints in their session. 

## QOL Improvements

* Add titles and authors to image with each prompt.
* Add conditional prompts, only added into the pool once certain prompts have been accepted or declined.
