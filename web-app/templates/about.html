                        In the intermingled worlds of human and non-human animals, we live our day-to-day lives. Each decision we make, no matter how big or how small, impact not only human communities, but various animal communities as well. Often, actions that benefit one community may end up hurting the other. Can humans and animals peacefully cohabitate?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was created with the intention to explore the many different ways in which human decisions impact animal lives. One of our main goals was to revisit the important ideas from various authors, artists, and philosophers that we have read about throughout this course, and consider how all these ideas can be tied together when thinking about the dynamic between human and animal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We wanted to put the player in the shoes of a leader who must make significant choices, and allow them to see how socio political decisions may impact the human and animal communities.

                        No animals were harmed in the making of this project.
