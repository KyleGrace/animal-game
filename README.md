## About

Inspired by Pitzer's Art and Animals course, we created a project to explore the relationship between human and non-human animals. At the time of this writing, this game currently lives at kylegrace.com

## Project Statement

In the intermingled worlds of human and non-human animals, we live our day-to-day lives. Each decision we make, no matter how big or how small, impact not only human communities, but various animal communities as well. Often, actions that benefit one community may end up hurting the other. Can humans and animals peacefully cohabitate?

This project was created with the intention to explore the many different ways in which human decisions impact animal lives. One of our main goals was to revisit the important ideas from various authors, artists, and philosophers that we have read about throughout this course, and consider how all these ideas can be tied together when thinking about the dynamic between human and animal.

We wanted to put the player in the shoes of a leader who must make significant choices, and allow them to see how socio political decisions may impact the human and animal communities. One of our challenges was encoding the complicated dynamics of the community into two binaries: human vs nonhuman. In addition, we wanted the game to reflect the actual impact on communities, not the human sentiment. For example, in the artwork Helena by Marco Evaristti, one goldfish was killed by an audience participant. This lead to many claims of animal cruelty. However, compared to the amount of animal product in traditional artworks via paints, brushes, and mediums, the overall production of Helena had a negligible effect on the animal community in general. In general, we wanted our game to capture the realistic impact on communities.

_No animals were harmed in the making of this project._
